    <h1>Do Your Zone 2!</h1>
    <!--Description: This app is a new idea that ive had to create a web app that allows you to create an account, log activities that you do and build towards a zone 2 mileage goal.<br>
        Zone 2 notoriously is a hard thing to get right. ive always had trouble keeping in zone and im always looking for ways to make it easier on myself. <br>
        What better way to combine my training goals and ambitions as a developer than to create something myself! More to come -->
    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <div>
        Welcome to Do Your Zone 2! Do you struggle with motivation to do horrificly slow runs/bikes/ergs. Do you feel your life wasting away before your very eyes? Then this app might be for you. <br>
        Simply create an account, log some activities and see that progress! Progress will only be made if your training HR average sits in between the parameters set at account creation.
